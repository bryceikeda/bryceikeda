I am a graduate research assistant in IRON Lab at the UNC. 

I received my M.S. and B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester. My current research interests revolve around Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality and Robots, a subfield of Human-Robot Interaction commonly refered to as VAM-HRI.
